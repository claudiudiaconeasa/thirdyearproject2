"Telephony in Greater Manchester","26/01/1878","Telephony in Greater Manchester - Telegraph manufacturer Charles Moseley instals a telephone between a hardware merchant (Thomas Hudson Ltd) on Shudehill to company offices on Dantzic Street, the first such telephone in regular use in the country. In November 1877, while telephony was in its infancy, just 18 months after Alexander Graham Bell had made the world's first phone call, Charles Moseley, the son of a Manchester rubber manufacturer (then making telegraph equipment), took an interest in Bell's work. Moseley employed an engineer called William Fereday Bottomley to obtain telephone instruments from the Bell Company in Boston, United States, and provided the Post Office with its first telephones. Bell himself had first demonstrated the telephone to Queen Victoria who placed the UK's first long distance call from Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, on 14 January 1878. Just twelve days later, after obtaining a licence from the Post Office, Moseley installed a telephone between a hardware merchants establishment (Thomas Hudson Ltd) on Shudehill, Manchester to the companies' offices on Dantzic Street: the first such telephone in regular use in the country.","Manchester","53.485743, -2.238689","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Bakelite_232L_With_Manchester_Drawer_Card.JPG/440px-Bakelite_232L_With_Manchester_Drawer_Card.JPG","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephony_in_Greater_Manchester"
