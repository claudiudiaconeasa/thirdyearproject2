David Wheeler Dies,13/12/2004,"Wheeler's contributions to the field included work on the Electronic delay storage automatic calculator (EDSAC) and the Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT). Along with Maurice Wilkes and Stanley Gill he was credited with the invention of the subroutine (which they referred to as the closed subroutine), and gave the first explanation of how to design software libraries; as a result, the jump to subroutine instruction was often called a Wheeler Jump. Wilkes published a paper in 1953 discussing relative addressing to facilitate the use of subroutines.","Cambridge, United Kingdom","52.204181, 0.114748",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/EDSAC_%2814%29_%28cropped%29.jpg,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wheeler_(computer_scientist)
