It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie, in which he said that he started his races not merely at the \"bang\" of the starting pistol, but at \"the B of the Bang\".\nThe sculpture was commissioned in 2003; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out-of-court settlement totalling £1.7 million.\nIn February 2009, Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage. Despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly, the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal. The core was sold for scrap in July 2012, with the 180 spikes reported to have been placed in storage for an undecided future use.","headline":"Britain's tallest self-supporting sculpture, the \"B of the Bang\", is unveiled in Manchester"},"media":{"url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/B_of_the_Bang_%28landscape%29.jpg/500px-B_of_the_Bang_%28landscape%29.jpg"},"start_date":{"month":"01","year":"2005","day":"12"}},{"text":{"text":"The Avro 679 Manchester was a British twin-engine medium bomber developed and manufactured by the Avro aircraft company in the United Kingdom. While not being built in great numbers, it was the forerunner of the famed and vastly more successful four-engined Avro Lancaster, which would become one of the most capable strategic bombers of the Second World War.\nAvro designed the Manchester in conformance with the requirements laid out by the British Air Ministry Specification P.13/36, which sought a capable medium bomber with which to equip the Royal Air Force (RAF) and to replace its inventory of twin-engine bombers, such as the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Handley Page Hampden and Vickers Wellington. Performing its maiden flight on 25 July 1939, the Manchester entered squadron service in November 1940, barely twelve months following the outbreak of the conflict.\nOperated by both RAF and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF); primarily as a result of its underdeveloped, underpowered and unreliable engines, the Manchester came to be regarded as an operational failure. Production was terminated in 1941; however, the Manchester was redesigned into a four-engined heavy bomber, powered by the Merlin engine instead, which became known as the Lancaster.","headline":"The Avro Manchester Mark III BT308, prototype of the Avro Lancaster heavy bomber, first flies, from RAF Ringway"},"media":{"url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Avro_Manchester_ExCC.jpg/600px-Avro_Manchester_ExCC.jpg"},"start_date":{"month":"01","year":"1941","day":"09"}},{"text":{"text":"Telephony in Greater Manchester - Telegraph manufacturer Charles Moseley instals a telephone between a hardware merchant (Thomas Hudson Ltd) on Shudehill to company offices on Dantzic Street, the first such telephone in regular use in the country.

Founded by John E. Blakeley, the company produced films in London on extremely low budgets. Blakeley's first studio consisted of a single soundstage in a loft space above a taxi garage. Whenever the filmmakers wanted to shoot a scene, they would first have to signal the mechanics below to stop working, so the noise from below wouldn't register on the soundtracks. Blakeley's first production was Boots! Boots! (1934), starring the young variety entertainer George Formby. Production values were so low that some scenes were filmed in semi-darkness, to hide the lack of set decorations. Despite the technical flaws, the debut film was a huge success in the local provinces, recouping Blakeley's investment several times over and launching George Formby as Britain's leading screen comedian. Within the year \"Blakeley's Productions, Ltd.\" had become \"The Mancunian Film Distributors, Ltd.\"","headline":"Release of first film produced at Mancunian Films' Dickenson Road Studios, a former Methodist chapel in Rusholme, Cup-tie Honeymoon"},"media":{"url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Dickenson.jpg/440px-Dickenson.jpg"},"start_date":{"month":"03","year":"1948","day":"18"}},{"text":{"text":"Owens College became the first affiliate college of the federal Victoria University in 1880.
