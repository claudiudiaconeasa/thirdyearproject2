" Manchester Victoria station is opened by the Manchester and Leeds Railway","01/01/1844","The Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR) was founded in 1836 and the company began building its line between Manchester and Leeds in 1837.  The M&LR built an extension from Miles Platting  to the station which opened on 1 January 1844. On this date, the Oldham  Road terminus was closed to passenger services and became a goods  station. The new station had a 852 ft (260 m) long single platform which  handled M&LR trains to Leeds and elsewhere at its eastern end. The  L&MR extended its line from Ordsall to Victoria and its trains operated from the western end from 4 May 1844, on which date its Liverpool Road station terminus became a goods station. The station was named Victoria in 1843. Its long, single-storey building designed by George Stephenson and completed by John Brogden was approached by a wooden footbridge over the River Irk before the river was culverted. Most of the original 1844 station buildings are standing including part of the original façade on Hunt's Bank. The L&MR became part of the Grand Junction Railway in 1845, which in turn amalgamated with other railways to create the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1846, and the M&LR amalgamated with other railways to create the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) the following year. The headquarters of the L&YR were based alongside Victoria.","Manchester","53.487807, -2.241501","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Manchester_Victoria_station_19-10-2009_12-11-47kopie.jpg/530px-Manchester_Victoria_station_19-10-2009_12-11-47kopie.jpg","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Victoria_station"

" Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, is authorised to construct the Bridgewater Canal; he appoints James Brindley as engineer","23/03/1759","The Bridgewater Canal connects Runcorn, Manchester and Leigh, in North West England. It was commissioned by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to transport coal from his mines in Worsley to Manchester. It was opened in 1761 from Worsley to Manchester, and later extended from Manchester to Runcorn, and then from Worsley to Leigh.The canal is connected to the Manchester Ship Canal via a lock at Cornbrook; to the Rochdale Canal in Manchester; to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook, southeast of Runcorn; and to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh. It once connected with the River Mersey at Runcorn but has since been cut off by a slip road to the Silver Jubilee Bridge.Following the construction of the Sankey Brook Navigation, Bridgewater has been argued to be the first true canal of the Industrial Revolution in England, and it required the construction of an aqueduct to cross the River Irwell, one of the first of its kind. Its success helped inspire a period of intense canal building in Britain, known as Canal Mania. It later faced intense competition from the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the Macclesfield Canal. Navigable throughout its history, it is one of the few canals in Britain not to have been nationalised, and remains privately owned. Pleasure craft now use the canal which forms part of the Cheshire Ring network of canals.","Manchester","53.383210, -2.484071","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Worsley_packet_house_closeup_large_image.jpg/650px-Worsley_packet_house_closeup_large_image.jpg","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Canal"
