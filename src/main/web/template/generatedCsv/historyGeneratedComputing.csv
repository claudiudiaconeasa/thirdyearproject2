"Java is introduced by Sun Microsystems","01/02/1991","Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.","Redwood Shores, California, United States","37.529738, -122.265727","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg/283px-Java_programming_language_logo.svg.png","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)"
